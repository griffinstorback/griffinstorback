#### Intro
I'm a mobile software developer. I make apps for iOS, with Swift.
<br>
I studied Computer Science at the University of Victoria, in British Columbia, Canada. I currently have 1 app available on the App Store (MessageMap), with another one soon to be released (WotMovie). See the ((Projects)) section.
